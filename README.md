# JavaFF-Planner
JavaFF is an implementation of the planner FF written in Java. Based on the source code for CRIKEY, written by Keith Halsey, it has been produced for this course to provide an extensible implementation of FF that cleanly separates the features we are interested in: search algorithm; heuristics; neighbourhoods; and so on.
